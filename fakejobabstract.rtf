Title: Companion App - A Machine Learning-Powered Job Portal\par
\par
Abstract:\par
\par
Companion App is an innovative job portal developed using the Django framework and SQLite database, integrating advanced machine learning models for the verification of job postings. The platform aims to enhance the job-seeking experience by providing a reliable and trustworthy environment for both employers and job seekers.\par
\par
Key Features:\par
\par
Machine Learning Verification:\par
The system employs machine learning models built with popular libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, and Seaborn. These models analyze job postings to distinguish between genuine and potentially fake listings, marking them as verified or unverified accordingly.\par
\par
Job Posting Lifecycle:\par
Employers can upload job postings with detailed descriptions. The verification process ensures the authenticity of the listings, and verified postings are made available for job seekers to explore. Unverified postings are flagged, offering transparency to users.\par
\par
User-Friendly Job Seeker Interface:\par
Job seekers can browse through a curated list of verified job postings, streamlining their search for genuine opportunities. The platform facilitates the submission of applications, with received applications forwarded to the respective companies for review.\par
\par
Company Interaction:\par
Companies can review applications received through the portal, make decisions regarding appointments, and communicate with applicants. The system maintains an organized record of appointment statuses and messages for both employers and job seekers.\par
\par
Administrative Oversight:\par
An admin panel provides tools for overseeing the verification process, ensuring the integrity of the job postings. Admins can monitor and manage the system's performance, contributing to a secure and reliable job portal environment.\par
\par
Overall, Companion App serves as a bridge between employers and job seekers, leveraging machine learning to establish trust in the authenticity of job postings. The incorporation of various modules and a user-friendly interface enhances the efficiency and effectiveness of the job search and recruitment process.\par
\par
\par
\par
\par
Existing System:\par
In the existing system, job portals typically rely on manual verification processes to ensure the authenticity of job postings. This often involves human intervention to review each listing, which can be time-consuming and prone to errors. The lack of automated verification mechanisms may lead to the presence of fake job postings, compromising the trust of both employers and job seekers. Additionally, the communication between companies and applicants may not be streamlined, and there may be a lack of centralized tools for administrators to oversee the job portal efficiently.\par
\par
Proposed System:\par
The proposed system, Companion App, introduces a machine learning-powered approach to job portal management, addressing the limitations of the existing system. Key features and improvements include:\par
\par
Machine Learning Verification:\par
\par
Utilizes machine learning models built with numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, and seaborn to automatically verify the authenticity of job postings.\par
Flags unverified postings, providing transparency to users and minimizing the presence of fake listings.\par
Streamlined Job Posting Lifecycle:\par
\par
Enables employers to upload detailed job postings, with automatic verification ensuring only genuine listings are marked as verified.\par
Job seekers can easily navigate through a curated list of verified job postings, enhancing their overall experience.\par
Enhanced User Interface for Job Seekers:\par
\par
Provides a user-friendly interface for job seekers to explore verified job opportunities and submit applications.\par
Facilitates efficient communication between companies and applicants, improving the overall user experience.\par
Company Interaction and Decision-Making:\par
\par
Companies can review applications received through the portal, make informed decisions, and communicate directly with applicants.\par
Maintains a structured record of appointment statuses and messages for both employers and job seekers, promoting transparency.\par
Administrative Oversight:\par
\par
Offers a dedicated admin panel with tools for overseeing the verification process and monitoring system performance.\par
Provides a centralized hub for administrators to manage and maintain the integrity of the job portal.\par
Overall, the proposed system leverages machine learning to automate the verification process, improving the efficiency, accuracy, and trustworthiness of the job portal. It also focuses on providing a seamless experience for both employers and job seekers, with enhanced communication and oversight capabilities for administrators.\par
